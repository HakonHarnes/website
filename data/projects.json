      "Img-clip is a cross-platform Neovim plugin for embedding images into markup languages like LaTeX, Markdown and Typst. One of the plugin's most notable features is its drag and drop functionality, allowing users to embed images by simply dragging them from their web browser or file explorer directly into the terminal. Additionally, img-clip provides a convenient way to paste images from the system clipboard, as well as integrations with external plugins through its powerful API.",
      "The plugin's markup templates offer extensive customization options, enabling users to configure cursor positioning, figure labels, and auto-generated file names to suit their specific needs. Img-clip also supports multiple image embedding methods, including saving images as files, using URLs, or even embedding them as Base64-encoded data within the document itself. Images from the web are automatically downloaded and embedded into the document. Img-clip also provides advanced image processing capabilities, such as compression and resizing, enabling users to optimize their images before embedding them.",
      "Since its release, img-clip has garnered significant recognition and support from the Neovim community, with over 1000 active users and more than 300 stars on GitHub. Its popularity even led to it being featured on the official Neovim Twitter account and showcased in a comprehensive, nearly hour-long video on YouTube. To learn more about img-clip and its capabilities, check out the links below."

It was found to be able to evade detection with little overhead. The compiler is based on the obfuscator-LLVM project, and it's built with Docker."
